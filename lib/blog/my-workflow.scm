Follow the guidelines exactly as they are printed and it will lead you to the destination that you seek. The second choice is to start with an empty board, and see what happens when you flip every single switch. In this second scenario you work from the bottom up, you learn every possible scenario. There is even the possibility that you could learn more than the manual writer.")
