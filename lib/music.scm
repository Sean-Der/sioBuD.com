It doesn't matter if I am listening to vinyl with a really close friend, trying to convince someone that noise music is relaxing or talking about music with a complete stranger. This is what I see as the beauty of music, the completely subjectivity of it. I love the irrational discussions I can have about it, it doesn't matter what band or genre I bet you someone is willing to defend its merit tooth and nail. This is why my undying obsession with music was born.")
